# future_proof
  Interactive website, AI neural network implementation (GPT2 and Char RNN)
  FutureProof is a network of four interactive AI Chatbots:
  The four bots are:
  swardspeak-bot : trained on social media posts in swardspeak (salitang beki)
  leather-bot: trained on gay leather datasets 
  manong-bot: trained on dialogue sets from archival I-hotel interviews
  showgirl-bot: trained on dialogue sets from SOMA cabaret performers  
  Together the bots speak to and from a specific moment of convergent queer and FilipinX   
  San Francisco SOMA communities and (his)stories.
  FutureProof makes it possible to text chat with the bots live on the web:
